Spinner: Oh hey! You finally made it!
<<Camera_Pan BeforeTut>>
<<wait 1.5>>
Spinner: This tree is so big...how are we going to explore it all?
Spinner: Ack! What is this stuff?
Spinner: Ewwwww, I'm so sticky and slow. I need to wash this off. 
<<Camera_Pan SapTut>>
<<wait 2.5>> 
Spinner: Whew, that's much better.
???: Frond...? Is that you?
Spinner: Eh? Who said that? There's no one here.
Spinner: Ah well, it's not like the tree can talk, right?
???: I assure you that I can, little spiderling.
Spinner: W-Woah! We're so sorry, we didn't know you were alive, please forgive us!
???: Not to worry. Any friend of Frond's is a friend of mine.
Spinner: Uhhhh...who?
???: Your quiet little companion over there. He's been caring for me ever since he arrived.
???: Speaking of which, I could use your help once again.
???: Those awful termites have returned, and it's been hard trying to get rid of them on my own. Could you get rid of them for me?
-> How can I do that?
    ???: You used to use my sap to fight them off, remember?
    ???: As long as you've got a good coat on, they'll stick to you and die right away.
-> Sorry, I'm not Frond.
    ???: Ohohoho! Frond, I may be old, but I've fallen for that joke before already.
    ???: Just be careful, if you touch them without a good coat of sap, they will eat you right away.
-> Leave it to me!
    ???: Thank you. I can always count on you.
    ???: Just be careful, if you touch them without a good coat of sap, they will eat you right away.
-> Spinner, get rid of the termites.
    Spinner: Waaaaaah?! I'm not going near those things!
    ???: Frond was just joking, little spiderling. If you touch them without a good coat of sap, they will eat you right away.
<<Next_Event Quest_02>>
Spinner: Got it! We'll be safe Mr. Tree!
Grover: Please, little spiderling, call me Grover.
Spinner: Will do Mr. Grover Tree!
<<wait 1>>
Spinner: Psssst. You didn't tell me your name was Frond. Is that your secret identity?
-> Frond is...my brother.
Spinner: Wait really? What if he's hiding here somewhere? We've GOTTA explore now!
Spinner: I'll meet you up ahead Sprig...or should I call you Frond and hide your secret identity...?
-> Sprig.
    Sprig it is! Two different names is pretty confusing, anyways.
-> Frond.
    Haha! Then I'll meet you up ahead, "Frond!"

Frond: ...S-Sprig?!
-> Frond!
-> Brother!
Frond: No no no, you can't be real. I'm still dreaming, right?
Frond: Tell me something only Sprig would know!
-> Uhhhh...
-> You're awake Frond.
Frond: AHA! The real Sprig would have slapped me awake by now! You're a fake!
-> Slap him.
    Frond: AHA! Even more proof! The Sprig I know wouldn't hurt a fly!
-> Do not.
Frond: Haaaah...well now that I know I'm asleep, wanna come with me?
Frond: I mean, you've got nothing better to do, right?
Frond: Come on! Let's Glide across!
-> ...What?
Frond: Ohhhh, I like this version of you Sprig! I get to teach you things like when we were younger.
<<Camera_Pan GlideTut>>
<<wait 3>>
Frond: When you're in the air, try jumping again. Spread yourself out and the rest should come naturally.
Frond: Give it a try!

Frond: Yay! I knew you could do it!
-> Frond, we need to talk.
-> Are you okay?
Frond: Uhhhhh...
Frond: *ahem* See this wind? If you glide over it, the draft will catch your leaves and push you up in the air.
<<Camera_Pan GlideTut2>>
<<wait 2.5>>
Frond: Meet me at the top of the tree! I believe in you!

    Frond: There's just something too nostalgic about it, y'know?
    <<wait 2.5>>
    Frond: Okay, that's enough sightseeing from me. I liked that a lot!
-> Play a game.
    Frond: Alright! How about a good old-fashioned game of hide and seek!

    Frond: And as my reward, you can go ahead and thank the developers for not programming you to play hide-and-seek with me!
    -> Thank the developers over on itch.io.
        Frond: Awww, I bet they're going to love it!
    -> Curse the developers instead.
        Frond: W-Woah.

            Frond: Ha...why do you have to be the reasonable one?
            Frond: All I wanted was to have fun like we used to.
            Frond: Was that really too much to ask?
            Frond: ...
            Frond: Alright. Let's talk. I'm sure you have questions.
            -> What happened to you?
            Frond: Same thing that happened to you.
            Frond: I woke up here, and I couldn't find you or Aloe anywhere.
            Frond: I was still feeling cold from...you know.
            Frond: After some wandering, I met Grover here.
            Frond: He was old and needed help, so I decided to stay for a bit.
            Frond: I could have left, but something about him...it reminded me of how you would help us no matter what.
            Frond: So I stayed. I was pretty happy too.
            -> Why did you leave Grover?
            Frond: I didn't mean to leave him.
            Frond: It's a bit of a funny story actually...well, as funny as you can get with abandoning someone.
            Frond: One day when I was cleaning up those termites, I was feeling sick.
            Frond: I'm not really sure why, but there wasn't any water to bring me back up to speed.
            Frond: I ended up...drinking that poison.
            Frond: Heh, you can laugh if you want. I really had no other options.
            Frond: Since then, I couldn't really get a grip on reality.
            Frond: ...That is, until now.
            Frond: I don't really know how you did it, but I'm feeling better now that I'm with you.
            -> Where's Aloe?
            Frond: ...I think she left me to look for you. I'll be honest, I'm not sure.
            Frond: But if I had to guess...she's in the one place I haven't looked.
            Frond: The Caves.
            Frond: It's not that simple though. The caves have something wrong with them. Grover can feel it.
            Frond: But there's some hope now. And that's you.
            Frond: Just look around us! Not only did you clean up those termites, you made Grover look better than I ever could!
            Frond: I'm not sure what you did, but if you did that to the caves, maybe exploring them won't be as deadly as most plants would think.
            -> I'm going to find her.
            <<Next_Event Quest_02>>
            Frond: I know you will. You're braver than I could ever be.
            Frond: When you find her...promise me you'll bring her home. I miss her.
            -> I promise.
            -> ...
            Frond: ...okay.
            Frond: I'll meet you both back home. There's two different paths that go into the cave.
            Frond: One's from the fields way down there. You must've gone by it on your way here.
            Frond: The other's underneath Grover. Ask him and he'll open up the path for you. And let him know I said it was okay.
            Frond: ...And Sprig?
            -> Yeah?
            Frond: I love you.
            Frond: Good luck.

Spinner: Sooooooo Sprog, how's the hunt going?
-> Pretty good so far.
    Spinner: Cool! Then I'll leave you to it!
-> I don't remember how to get rid of them...
    Spinner: Don't worry, I can help you! Like a sidekick!
    Spinner: Mr. Grover said if you're covered in sap then you can touch them.
    Spinner: Hmmm, I need some sort of quip...
    Spinner: ...is "crap" a swear word?
    -> Yes.
        Spinner: "If you're full of sap, the termites won't strike back!"
    -> No.
        Spinner: "If you're full of sap, they won't make you crap!"

        Spinner: "If you're full of sap..."

-> It's easy to get lost here.
    Spinner: Yeah, I've always wanted to explore this place.
    Spinner: My mom never let me, but she's...w-well, she's not here right now.

    Spinner: I'm not too worried about getting lost though.
    Spinner: If you get lost, just remember: SLACK!
    Spinner: That stands for Saves, Landmarks, And Checkpoints...Kool!
-> ...What did you just call me?
    Spinner: Hmmm? What?
    -> What. Did. You. Just. Call. Me.
    Spinner: Ooooooh, I called you Sprog!
    -> Why.
    Spinner: Well, remember when I asked you what I should call you?
    Spinner: I didn't really like "Sprig" or "Frond," so I combined the two!
    Spinner: Pretty creative, right? Now you've got a superhero name!
    -> Awesome!
        Spinner: Awwww stop, you're making me blush.
    -> Don't ever call me such a stupid name ever again.
        Spinner: O-Oh...
        Spinner: I, uh, I see...
        Spinner: ...
        -> Apologize to the child.
            Spinner: Yay! Sprog!
        -> Do not.
            Spinner: ...............................
            -> Apologize and end this sadness.
                Spinner: Yay! Sprog!
            -> Do not.
                Spinner: .......................................................................................................................................
                -> Give a half-baked apology and just roll along with it.
                Spinner: Yay! Sprog!
