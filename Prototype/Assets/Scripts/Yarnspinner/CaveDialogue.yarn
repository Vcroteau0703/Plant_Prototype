Aloe: Haaaaaaah...thank you Sprig.
-> Aloe...
-> Sister...
Aloe: You know, I almost didn't recognize you. You look better than before.
Aloe: And that's not all that's new, is it?
Aloe: I know you've been bringing life back to this sad world.
Aloe: Leave it to you to make light out of a dark situation, right?
Aloe: But if you can do that, maybe this world isn't nearly as doomed as I had thought.
-> What are you talking about?
Aloe: Still haven't figured it out? Well, I'll keep things brief.
Aloe: We're dead.
Aloe: ...and it's because of me.
<<wait 2>>
Aloe: I'm sorry. For everything.
Aloe: I know the blizzard wasn't my fault, but it's something I could have stopped.
Aloe: I could've kept an eye on you. I could've helped Frond back at home. Instead...
Aloe: If I was just like you...maybe...
-> Maybe...?
    Aloe: Maybe this wouldn't have happened.
    Aloe: I wouldn't have come here and done this.
    Aloe: Isn't that the worst part?
    Aloe: I wasn't there for either of your final moments.
-> It's okay.
    Aloe: Ha, don't kid yourself.
    Aloe: Just look at where we are because of me.
    Aloe: It literally doesn't get worse than this.
-> You're special too.
    Aloe: Stop.
    Aloe: I don't need to hear about how I'm special in my own way.
    Aloe: I abandoned you. I abandoned Frond. My family.
    Aloe: And now we're all here because I wasn't.
-> I forgive you.
Aloe: ...You can pretend to forgive me all you want, but deep down, we both know how you really feel.
Aloe: Go on, let it out.
-> I love you.
<<wait 5>>
Aloe: ...I-
-> Come on. Let's go home.

March 2001.
I feel that there's no escape from this storm.
If it continues at this rate, we're all dead. There's no other way around it.

But, if I can find it, it'll all be worth it.
The local fungus helps a lot. I'd be lost without them.
Who knows? Maybe they'll lead me somewhere if I follow them?

In the meantime, I may as well keep writing.
I often despise my ancestors for ruining my family name with a line of failures.
But a doorway to the afterlife and back?
Maybe they were onto something.

Aloe: Frond, get the cake or I'm tossing you into the water.
Frond: Okay, okay, no need to be so dramatic.
<<wait 1>>
Aloe: Heh, now that he's gone, lemme ask you.
Aloe: How are you enjoying your birthday so far?
-> H e l p   m e .
Aloe: Oh phew! That's a relief.
Aloe: I was worried, I know it's been a tough year for you.
Aloe: And I know I was being kinda cold earlier...
Aloe: ...but I really am happy we're all together this year.
Frond: Hey, can I get a hand?! Normally I'm all for a fun challenge, but this cake is huge!
Aloe: Heh, be right back.
Aloe: Want me to get you anything while I'm helping Frond out?

Aloe: You're right, it is a little stormy looking...
Aloe: I'm sure it's not a problem. We'll only be gone a minute!
<<wait 4>>
