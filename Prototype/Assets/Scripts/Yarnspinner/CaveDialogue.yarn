You're late.
Bring the four here. Then we can talk.

Heh...you're special, and I really mean that.
I watched you grow that vine outside without lifting a finger.
And if you can do that, maybe this world isn't nearly as doomed as I had thought.
...
I'm sorry. For everything.
I understand that it isn't my fault, and yet, it's something I could have stopped.
If I was just like you...maybe...
-> You're special too.
Stop.
I don't need to hear about how I'm special in my own way.
I abandoned you. I abandoned Frond. My family.
And now we're all here because I wasn't.
You can pretend to forgive me all you want, but deep down, we both know how you really feel.
Go on, let it out.
-> I love you.
<<wait 5>>
...
-> Come on. Let's go home.
<<wait 1>>
*Aloe joined your party.*

March 2001.
I feel that there's no escape from this storm.
If it continues at this rate, we're all dead. There's no other way around it.

But, if I can find it, it'll all be worth it.
The local fungus helps a lot. I'd be lost without them.
Who knows? Maybe they'll lead me somewhere if I follow them?

I often despise my ancestors for ruining my family name with a bloodline of failures.
But a doorway to the afterlife and back?
Maybe they were onto something.
