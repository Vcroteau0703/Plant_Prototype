You're late.
Bring the four here. Then we can talk.

Aloe: Heh...you're special, and I really mean that.
Aloe: I watched you grow that vine outside without lifting a finger.
Aloe: And if you can do that, maybe this world isn't nearly as doomed as I had thought.
Aloe: ...
Aloe: I'm sorry. For everything.
Aloe: I understand that it isn't my fault, and yet, it's something I could have stopped.
Aloe: If I was just like you...maybe...
-> You're special too.
Aloe: Stop.
Aloe: I don't need to hear about how I'm special in my own way.
Aloe: I abandoned you. I abandoned Frond. My family.
Aloe: And now we're all here because I wasn't.
Aloe: You can pretend to forgive me all you want, but deep down, we both know how you really feel.
Aloe: Go on, let it out.
-> I love you.
<<wait 5>>
Aloe: ...
-> Come on. Let's go home.
<<wait 1>>
*Aloe joined your party.*

March 2001.
I feel that there's no escape from this storm.
If it continues at this rate, we're all dead. There's no other way around it.

But, if I can find it, it'll all be worth it.
The local fungus helps a lot. I'd be lost without them.
Who knows? Maybe they'll lead me somewhere if I follow them?

I've decided to write some more while I'm exploring here.
I often despise my ancestors for ruining my family name with a bloodline of failures.
But a doorway to the afterlife and back?
Maybe they were onto something.

Aloe: Frond, get the cake or I'm tossing you into the water.
Frond: Okay, okay, no need to be so dramatic.
<<wait 1>>
Aloe: Heh, now that he's gone, lemme ask you.
Aloe: How are you enjoying your birthday so far?
-> H e l p   m e .
Aloe: Oh phew! That's a relief.
Aloe: I was worried, I know it's been a tough year for you.
Aloe: And I know I was being kinda cold earlier...
Aloe: ...but I really am happy we're all together this year.
Frond: Hey, can I get a hand?! Normally I'm all for a fun challenge, but this cake is huge!
Aloe: Heh, be right back.
Aloe: Want me to get you anything while I'm helping Frond out?
